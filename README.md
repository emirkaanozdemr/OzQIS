# OzQIS

**OzQIS: Evaluating Quantum Learning**  
Developed by **Emir Kaan Ã–zdemir** and **Emre DinÃ§**

This repository contains the implementation code for **OzQIS: Evaluating Quantum Learning**, a novel metric designed to evaluate quantum machine learning models from an interpretability perspective.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

OzQIS is a metric that enables researchers and practitioners to assess the interpretability and structure of quantum learning models. It serves as a diagnostic tool to understand how effectively quantum models learn from data, inspired by classical explainability approaches, adapted to the unique nature of quantum information.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

To use the OzQIS metric in your own quantum learning projects, you can install it directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install ozqis
```
---

## ðŸ”© Implementation

To implement OzQIS to your own model, you can use `implementation/library_implementation.py` code as an example.

---

## Academical Contribution
This code was designed for the **OzQIS: Evaluating Quantum Learning** article submitted to the **Journal of Machine Learning Research.**
